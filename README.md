1. What you chose to implement and why.

Basically when i was browsing on Internet for Open-source dataset , I found the dataset that was trained on one model that is logistic regression . As it was a classification probem i tried to improve the accuracy but as the dataset was structured so well then i realised after checking other models that it was giving best accuracy on the first used model that is logistic regression . 

2. How to run your code.

First open vs - code 
Then pip install -r requirements.txt that contains all necessary libraries to install for this project 

3. Any assumptions or limitations.
Limitation - Its not an end to end project (It's just a mini project basically that explain  the backend logic . You can deploy it using streamlit or flask .)


C. Reflection
A brief section (5–10 sentences) sharing your experience using the coding assistant.
specifically addressing:
● Did it help you move faster?
● Did it generate incorrect or surprising suggestions?
● Where was it most or least useful?

Yes coding assistance is helpfull when you forgot syntax or you get confused what to do.
Sometimes when you ask some question to it gives some suprising result new concept that you 
don't knoow . You can learn it if you have time but if you want the answer according to the concept you know then be carefull while prompting.
